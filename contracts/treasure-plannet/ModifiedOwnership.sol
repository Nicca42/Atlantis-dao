 * @notice  This contract has been modified away from the OZ standard Ownable in
 *          order to allow ownership to be represented by an NFT token.
 *          The owner of the NFT will have ownership rights over the owned 
 *          contract.
 * @dev     Contract module which provides a basic access control mechanism, 
 *          where there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive 
 *          access to specific functions.
 *          This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the 
 *          modifier `onlyOwner`, which can be applied to your functions to 
 *          restrict their use to the owner.
